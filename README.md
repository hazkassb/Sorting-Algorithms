# Implementations of Common Sorting Algorithms in Java

These are my implementations of the following sorting algorithms:

## - Insertion sort
### Time Complexity: O(n^2) in the worst case and O(n) in case the array is already sorted
### Space Complexity: O(1) ==> Sorting is done in-place.

- selection sort
### Time Complexity: O(n^2)
### Space Complexity: O(1) ==> Sorting is done in-place.

- Merge sort
### Time Complexity: O(n) time is required for a sort
### Space Complexity: O(n) additional space is required for the merge ==> The array cannot be merged in place

- Shell sort
### Time Complexity: O(n^2) is the worst case, and O(n^[3/2]) in the best case
### Space Complexity: O(1) ==> Sorting is done in-place.

PS: All the methods are generic and can be use to sort all kind of Comparable objects.
